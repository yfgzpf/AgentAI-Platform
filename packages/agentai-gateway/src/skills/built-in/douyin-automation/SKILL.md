# Douyin Automation Skill

This skill automates Douyin operations on an Android device through the Another MCP server.

## Prerequisites

1. Another desktop app must be running with MCP Server enabled
2. Android device connected via USB with USB debugging enabled
3. Douyin app installed on the device

## Workflow

Always follow this order:

1. **List devices** to see what's available
2. **Connect** to establish a control session
3. **Screenshot** to see the current screen state
4. **Act** using touch, text, buttons, swipe, etc.
5. **Screenshot again** to verify the result
6. **Disconnect** when done

## Available Tools

### Device Management

| Tool | What it does |
|------|--------------|
| `another_list_devices` | List all connected Android devices |
| `another_connect_device` | Connect to a device (starts scrcpy control session) |
| `another_disconnect_device` | Disconnect from the current device |

### Observation

| Tool | What it does |
|------|--------------|
| `another_take_screenshot` | Capture the screen as a PNG image |

### Input

| Tool | What it does |
|------|--------------|
| `another_press_button` | Press a hardware button: `home`, `back`, `recents`, `power`, `volume_up`, `volume_down` |
| `another_send_text` | Type text into the focused input field |
| `another_send_touch` | Send a touch event (`down`, `up`, `move`) at normalized coordinates (0.0-1.0) |
| `another_send_scroll` | Scroll at a position with a given delta |
| `another_swipe` | Swipe from one point to another (normalized 0.0-1.0 coordinates) |

### Apps & Shell

| Tool | What it does |
|------|--------------|
| `another_launch_app` | Launch an app by package name (e.g. `com.ss.android.ugc.aweme`) |
| `another_open_url` | Open a URL in the device's default browser |
| `another_shell` | Run an arbitrary adb shell command and get the output |

## Coordinate System

Touch, swipe, and scroll tools use **normalized coordinates** from 0.0 to 1.0:
- `(0.0, 0.0)` = top-left corner
- `(1.0, 1.0)` = bottom-right corner
- `(0.5, 0.5)` = center of screen

## Common Patterns

### Tap on something
```
another_send_touch { action: "down", x: 0.5, y: 0.5 }
another_send_touch { action: "up", x: 0.5, y: 0.5 }
```

### Tap, then verify
```
1. another_take_screenshot  (see what's on screen)
2. another_send_touch       (tap where you need to)
3. another_take_screenshot  (verify the result)
```

### Type into a field
```
1. Tap the input field with another_send_touch
2. another_send_text { text: "hello world" }
```

### Scroll down a page
```
another_send_scroll { x: 0.5, y: 0.5, dx: 0.0, dy: -1.0 }
```

### Swipe to go back or navigate
```
another_swipe { from_x: 0.0, from_y: 0.5, to_x: 0.5, to_y: 0.5 }
```

### Navigate with buttons
```
another_press_button { button: "home" }
another_press_button { button: "back" }
another_press_button { button: "recents" }
```

### Open an app and interact
```
1. another_launch_app { package: "com.ss.android.ugc.aweme" }
2. Wait briefly, then another_take_screenshot
3. Interact as needed
```

### Find an element on screen
Take a screenshot, examine it to identify positions, then use the coordinates to interact. Screenshots are the primary way to understand what's visible on the device.

### Run a shell command
```
another_shell { command: "pm list packages" }
another_shell { command: "dumpsys battery" }
another_shell { command: "settings get system screen_brightness" }
```

## Tips

- **Always screenshot first** before interacting. You need to see the screen to know where to tap.
- **Screenshot after actions** to confirm they worked.
- **Use shell commands** for things that don't need the screen (checking battery, listing packages, getting device info).
- **Swipe duration** defaults to 300ms. Increase `duration_ms` for slower, more deliberate swipes.
- **Connect before acting**. Tools like press_button, send_text, send_touch, swipe require an active connection via `another_connect_device`.
- **list_devices, shell, take_screenshot, wifi_* tools** work without a scrcpy connection, they only need adb.
